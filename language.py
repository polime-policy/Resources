# Example usage
text = "As quantum technologies rise to the forefront of computing, the United States must proactively safeguard our citizensâ€™ sensitive data and digital systems from the next generation of 'quantum cyber-attacks.' As stated by a 2021 McKinsey report, experts forecast quantum computers will be advanced enough to crack existing cryptography protocols by 2030, placing individuals, organizations, and national security at serious risk. Thus, if the quantum computing industry is left to grow unregulated, we are all threatened by widespread data breaches, intellectual property theft, financial losses, and even physical harm."
